Hi! I'm <b>Sangwon</b>.<br>
I'm currently a <b> Ph.D. student </b> in <a href="https://www.american.edu/spa/dpap/index.cfm" target="_blank"> at School of Public Affairs, American University</a>. My research interests broadly lie in public management, organizational theory and behavior, behavioral public administration, and artificial intelligence and decision-making. I am also interested in research methods, particularly in the application of computational techniques (such as text analysis) and causal inference approach.<br>
I aim to understand how bureaucracy and bureaucrats contribute to the creation of public value. First, I study how both citizens and bureaucrats perceive organizational structures from a psycho-cognitive perspective and how structures can be designed to balance social equity and effectiveness. Second, I explore how public employees’ identity processes serve as the microfoundations of citizen–bureaucracy interactions. Third, I examine how artificial intelligence, information systems, and bureaucratic discretion interact and how technology can be managed to improve societal outcomes.<br>
Other than research, I enjoy traveling to countries around the world: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1EL3lmIvsf7OJClETAXOsiJUonQRItdQ&usp=sharing" target="_blank">My Maps</a>.

  Foundational ideas of justice can separate out some basic issues as being inescapably relevant, but they cannot plausibly end up, I have argued, with an exclusive choice of some highly delineated formula of relative weights as being the unique blueprint for ‘the just society’. (Sen, 1999: p. 286) </div>

  Work for the elimination of concrete evils rather than for the realization of abstract goods. Do not aim at establishing happiness by political means. Rather aim at the elimination of concrete miseries. [...] But, do all this by direct means. (Popper, 1963: p. 360) </div>
